It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nOnline documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).\n\nThe docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.\n\nTo build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nSeaborn supports Python 3.8+.\n\nInstallation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:\n\n    pip install seaborn\n\nIt is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies:\n\n    pip install seaborn[stats]\n\nSeaborn can also be installed with conda:\n\n    conda install seaborn\n\nNote that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.\n\nCiting\n------\n\nA paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTesting seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).\n\nTo test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.\n\nCode style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nSeaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn\n\nPlease submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem.

Code Organization and Architecture\n\n### Q1: How is the codebase structured?\n**A:** The Seaborn codebase is organized into several key directories:\n- `ci`: Contains continuous integration configurations.\n- `doc`: Holds documentation files, including templates, static assets, and tutorials.\n- `examples`: Contains example scripts demonstrating how to use Seaborn.\n- `licences`: Includes licensing information.\n- `seaborn`: The main package directory, which contains submodules for core functionality, marks, statistics, colors, and external dependencies.\n- `tests`: Contains unit tests organized into subdirectories corresponding to the main package modules.\n\n### Q2: What are the key modules and their responsibilities?\n**A:** The main modules in the `seaborn` directory include:\n- `_core`: Contains core functions and classes for creating visualizations.\n- `_marks`: Manages the visual elements (marks) used in plots.\n- `_stats`: Implements statistical functions and methods.\n- `colors`: Handles color palettes and color-related utilities.\n- `external`: Contains code that interfaces with external libraries or tools.\n\n### Q3: How do the different components interact?\n**A:** Components in Seaborn interact through a well-defined API. For example, the `_core` module uses functions from `_stats` to compute statistical transformations before plotting. The plotting functions in `_core` call upon the `_marks` module to render visual elements, while color handling is managed by the `colors` module. This modular design allows for clear separation of concerns and easier maintenance.\n\n## 2. Common Patterns and Conventions\n\n### Q4: What design patterns are commonly used?\n**A:** Seaborn employs several design patterns, including:\n- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating different types of plots based on user input.\n- **Decorator Pattern**: Used to enhance functions with additional functionality, such as adding default parameters or modifying behavior.\n- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for selecting different statistical methods based on the type of data being visualized.\n\n### Q5: What are the naming conventions and code style expectations?\n**A:** Seaborn follows PEP 8 style guidelines. Key conventions include:\n- Function names are in `snake_case`.\n- Class names use `CamelCase`.\n- Constants are in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.\n- Modules are named in `lowercase`.\n\n### Q6: Are there specific patterns for implementing new features?\n**A:** When implementing new features, follow these steps:\n1. Identify the appropriate module for the feature (e.g., `_core` for new plots).\n2. Write unit tests in the corresponding `tests` subdirectory.\n3. Ensure the feature adheres to existing design patterns and naming conventions.\n4. Update documentation in the `doc` directory to reflect the new feature.\n\n## 3. Typical Debugging Approaches\n\n### Q7: What are common error patterns and their solutions?\n**A:** Common error patterns include:\n- **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed, especially when using optional features. Use `pip install seaborn[stats]` for statistical functionalities.\n- **Attribute Errors**: Check if the function or attribute exists in the module. Use `dir(module)` to inspect available attributes.\n\n### Q8: How to debug specific types of issues in this codebase?\n**A:** For debugging:\n- Use `print` statements or logging to trace variable values and flow.\n- Utilize `pytest` for running tests and identifying failing cases.\n- Check the `tests` directory for existing tests that may cover the area of concern.\n\n### Q9: What are common pitfalls when modifying this code?\n**A:** Common pitfalls include:\n- Not updating the corresponding tests when modifying functionality.\n- Forgetting to run `make lint` to check for style issues.\n- Not documenting changes in the `doc` directory, leading to outdated documentation.\n\n## 4. Implementation Details\n\n### Q10: How are core abstractions implemented?\n**A:** Core abstractions in Seaborn are implemented as classes and functions in the `_core` module. For example, the `FacetGrid` class allows for creating multi-plot grids based on categorical variables, encapsulating the logic for layout and plotting.\n\n### Q11: What are the key algorithms or data structures used?\n**A:** Key algorithms include:\n- Statistical transformations (e.g., kernel density estimation) implemented in `_stats`.\n- Data handling using `pandas` DataFrames for managing datasets.\n- Color mapping algorithms in the `colors` module to apply color palettes to visual elements.\n\n### Q12: How does the error handling system work?\n**A:** Error handling in Seaborn typically uses Python's built-in exceptions. Custom exceptions may be raised for specific errors, such as invalid input types. Functions often include checks at the beginning to validate parameters and raise informative error messages.\n\n## 5. Testing Considerations\n\n### Q13: How is testing typically done in this codebase?\n**A:** Testing is done using `pytest`. To run tests, execute `make test` in the source directory. This command runs all unit tests and generates a coverage report. Tests are organized in the `tests` directory, mirroring the structure of the main package.\n\n### Q14: What should be considered when writing tests?\n**A:** When writing tests:\n- Ensure tests cover both typical and edge cases.\n- Use fixtures to set up common test scenarios.\n- Follow the naming convention for test functions, typically starting with `test_`.\n\n### Q15: Are there common test fixtures or utilities?\n**A:** Common test utilities include:\n- Fixtures for creating sample datasets or configurations.\n- Helper functions for asserting plot properties (e.g., checking if a plot contains expected elements).\n- Mocking utilities to simulate external dependencies or complex data inputs.\n\n### Q16: How can I contribute to the testing framework?\n**A:** To contribute to the testing framework:\n1. Write new tests in the appropriate `tests` subdirectory.\n2. Ensure tests are comprehensive and cover new features or bug fixes.\n3. Run all tests locally to verify that your changes do not break existing functionality.\n\n### Q17: How do I run tests for specific modules?\n**A:** To run tests for specific modules, you can use the command:\n```bash\npytest tests/_core\n```\nReplace `_core` with the desired module name. This will execute only the tests in that subdirectory.\n\n### Q18: What tools are used for code quality checks?\n**A:** Code quality checks are performed using `flake8` for linting and `pytest` for testing. You can run `make lint` to check for style issues and ensure adherence to coding standards.\n\n### Q19: How do I set up a development environment for Seaborn?\n**A:** To set up a development environment:\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn.git`\n2. Navigate to the directory: `cd seaborn`\n3. Install dependencies: `pip install -e .[dev]`\n4. Run tests to verify the setup: `make test`\n\n### Q20: Where can I find more information about contributing?\n**A:** More information about contributing can be found in the repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, which outlines the process for submitting issues, pull requests, and coding standards. Additionally, the issue tracker on GitHub is a good place to report bugs or request features.", refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1746462756, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_0392822090', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1538, prompt_tokens=1372, total_tokens=2910, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))
