It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nOnline documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).\n\nThe docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.\n\nTo build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nSeaborn supports Python 3.8+.\n\nInstallation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:\n\n    pip install seaborn\n\nIt is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies:\n\n    pip install seaborn[stats]\n\nSeaborn can also be installed with conda:\n\n    conda install seaborn\n\nNote that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.\n\nCiting\n------\n\nA paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTesting seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).\n\nTo test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.\n\nCode style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nSeaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn\n\nPlease submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem. Questions about usage are more at home on StackOverflow, where there is a [seaborn tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/seaborn).\n\n\nPlease provide the following insights. For each point, provide concrete details and specific examples from the codebase - high-level doesn\'t mean vague, it means providing a clear architectural overview with specific names, patterns, and implementations:\n\n1. Core Purpose and Functionality: \n    - What specific problem does this repository solve?\n    - What are its primary features and capabilities?\n\n2. Main Architectural Patterns:\n    - Identify concrete architectural patterns used in this codebase\n    - EXAMPLE: Plugin based architecture, layered architecture, etc\n\n3. Module Organization:\n    - Name the specific key modules and their exact responsibilities\n    - EXAMPLE: I/O module, error-handling module, etc\n\n4. Key Abstractions and Concepts:\n    - List the actual fundamental abstractions used in the codebase\n    - EXAMPLE: Quantity class for numerical values, Logger class for logging, etc\n\n5. Design Patterns:\n    - Identify specific recurring code patterns with examples\n    - EXAMPLE: Factory methods, Decorators, etc\n\n6. Error Handling Approaches:\n    - Describe precise error handling mechanisms used in the codebase\n    - EXAMPLE: Custom exception hierarchies, warnings, etc\n\nFocus on providing actionable architectural insights that would be valuable for understanding the repository\'s design philosophy and core abstractions. Your response should contain specific implementation details that would help someone understand how to navigate, extend, and debug the codebase to solve issues.\n'}], 'n': 1, 'temperature': 0, 'max_tokens': 15000, 'logprobs': False, 'store': True}

Core Purpose and Functionality\n- **Problem Solved**: Seaborn is designed to simplify the process of creating attractive and informative statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface that abstracts away much of the complexity involved in data visualization.\n- **Primary Features and Capabilities**:\n  - **Statistical Plotting**: Offers a variety of statistical plots such as scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, and heatmaps.\n  - **Data Handling**: Integrates seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames, allowing for easy manipulation and visualization of data.\n  - **Customization**: Provides extensive options for customizing plots, including themes, color palettes, and styles.\n  - **Built-in Themes**: Comes with several built-in themes to enhance the aesthetics of the plots.\n  - **Faceting**: Supports faceting, which allows users to create multiple plots based on subsets of the data.\n\n### 2. Main Architectural Patterns\n- **Layered Architecture**: The repository exhibits a layered architecture where different layers handle specific responsibilities:\n  - **Core Layer**: Contains the fundamental plotting functions and data handling (e.g., `seaborn/_core`).\n  - **Statistical Layer**: Implements statistical functions and models (e.g., `seaborn/_stats`).\n  - **Marks Layer**: Manages the visual representation of data (e.g., `seaborn/_marks`).\n  \n### 3. Module Organization\n- **Key Modules and Responsibilities**:\n  - **`seaborn/_core`**: Contains the core plotting functions and utilities for creating visualizations.\n  - **`seaborn/_marks`**: Responsible for defining the visual elements (marks) used in plots, such as points, lines, and areas.\n  - **`seaborn/_stats`**: Implements statistical functions and methods that can be applied to data before visualization.\n  - **`seaborn/colors`**: Manages color palettes and color mapping for visualizations.\n  - **`tests`**: Contains unit tests organized by module to ensure code reliability and correctness.\n\n### 4. Key Abstractions and Concepts\n- **Fundamental Abstractions**:\n  - **Plot Classes**: Each type of plot (e.g., `scatterplot`, `boxplot`) is typically represented by a class that encapsulates the plotting logic and parameters.\n  - **Palette Class**: Manages color palettes, allowing users to define and customize color schemes for their plots.\n  - **FacetGrid**: A key abstraction for creating multi-plot grids based on categorical variables, facilitating the visualization of complex datasets.\n\n### 5. Design Patterns\n- **Factory Methods**: Used to create plot objects based on user input. For example, the `seaborn.relplot()` function can create different types of relational plots based on the parameters passed.\n- **Decorator Pattern**: Utilized for enhancing the functionality of plotting functions, such as adding additional layers or modifying existing plots without altering the core plotting logic.\n- **Context Managers**: Used to manage plot settings (like styles and contexts) temporarily, ensuring that changes are reverted after the plotting is done.\n\n### 6. Error Handling Approaches\n- **Custom Exception Hierarchies**: Seaborn defines specific exceptions for handling errors related to plotting, such as `SeabornError`, which can be raised when invalid parameters are provided to plotting functions.\n- **Warnings**: The library uses Python's built-in `warnings` module to issue warnings for deprecated features or potential issues in user input, guiding users towards best practices without breaking functionality.\n\n### Conclusion\nUnderstanding the Seaborn repository's structure and design philosophy is crucial for effectively navigating, extending, and debugging the codebase. The layered architecture, modular organization, and use of design patterns provide a robust framework for statistical data visualization, while the clear abstractions and error handling mechanisms enhance usability and maintainability. This overview should serve as a valuable guide for anyone looking to work with or contribute to the Seaborn library.", refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1746462247, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_0392822090', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=877, prompt_tokens=1377, total_tokens=2254, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))
