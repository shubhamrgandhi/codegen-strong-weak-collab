It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nOnline documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).\n\nThe docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.\n\nTo build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nSeaborn supports Python 3.8+.\n\nInstallation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:\n\n    pip install seaborn\n\nIt is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies:\n\n    pip install seaborn[stats]\n\nSeaborn can also be installed with conda:\n\n    conda install seaborn\n\nNote that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.\n\nCiting\n------\n\nA paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTesting seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).\n\nTo test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.\n\nCode style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nSeaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn\n\nPlease submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem.

These questions and answers touch on code organization, design patterns, debugging tips, implementation details, and testing practices in the codebase.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. What is the overall structure of the seaborn repository?  \n• The repository is organized into several top‐level directories that separate concerns:  \n\u2003 – ci: Contains configuration and scripts for continuous integration (tests, style checks, code coverage).  \n\u2003 – doc: Holds documentation sources, including Sphinx templates, custom extensions, and build tools.  \n\u2003 – examples: A collection of example scripts and notebooks demonstrating seaborn’s usage.  \n\u2003 – licences: Contains license files, ensuring legal clarity for redistribution.  \n\u2003 – seaborn: The main package folder with subdirectories (_core, _marks, _stats, colors, external) that implement plotting, statistical routines, and styling.  \n\u2003 – tests: Structured similarly to the package (with subfolders for _core, _marks, _stats) to ensure each module is tested thoroughly.  \n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. How are the key modules in the seaborn package organized and what are their responsibilities?  \n• The seaborn package is subdivided as follows:  \n\u2003 – _core: Contains the fundamental plotting building blocks. These include base classes and functions that set up plot canvases, figure contexts, and coordinate common plotting behavior.  \n\u2003 – _marks: Implements the visual “marks” or elements (e.g., points, bars) that are drawn on plots.  \n\u2003 – _stats: Houses statistical functionality such as data transformations, aggregations, or regression computations that inform visualization choices.  \n\u2003 – colors: Provides color palettes, mapping utilities, and functions to support the aesthetic consistency of plots.  \n\u2003 – external: Serves as a bridge for integrating external libraries or wrapping third-party functionalities.  \n• In practice, high-level plotting functions depend on these modules: a typical plot may first compute statistical results (_stats), then use core plot scaffolding (_core) and finally draw individual elements (_marks) with styles from colors.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. How is the testing infrastructure set up and why is its structure important?  \n• The tests folder mirrors the organization of the production code with subdirectories for _core, _marks, and _stats.  \n• This mirror structure ensures that each module’s functionality is independently verified. For example, when you modify a feature in _stats, corresponding tests in tests/_stats can be updated or extended to cover the changes.  \n• Running “make test” (which leverages pytest) exercises all these tests, and a coverage report is generated to help identify any untested areas.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. What coding conventions and style expectations should I follow when modifying the code?  \n• The code adheres to PEP 8 guidelines, and style is enforced using flake8, as specified in the setup.cfg file.  \n• Pre-commit hooks are available (via “pre-commit install”) to catch style and formatting issues before commits.  \n• Naming conventions typically use lowercase, underscores for module names—even for internal modules (e.g., _core, _stats)—which signal that these are not part of the public API.  \n• When adding new features, ensure that your code is well documented (with meaningful docstrings) and that it seamlessly integrates with the existing structure.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Which design patterns or programming practices are common in the seaborn codebase?  \n• Seaborn makes use of simple, modular design:  \n\u2003 – The functional decomposition pattern is evident, with each submodule handling a distinct responsibility (rendering, statistical processing, and styling).  \n\u2003 – Object-oriented principles are applied where classes encapsulate plot behaviors and contexts. For example, core plot objects manage state (e.g., figure and axis settings) while delegating rendering tasks to mark modules.  \n\u2003 – Decorators and higher-order functions are sometimes used to manage state changes (like style contexts) or to add logging and error checks seamlessly.  \n• When implementing new features, following the modular design—where new functionality is neatly compartmentalized and tested independently—is recommended.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. How do different components of the codebase interact during plotting?  \n• High-level plotting APIs in seaborn typically perform the following steps:  \n\u2003 – Input data is first processed (often using functions from the _stats module) to compute necessary aggregates or fits.  \n\u2003 – The _core module sets up the plot axes, layouts, and overall figure context.  \n\u2003 – The _marks modules then render individual graphical elements (lines, bars, points), using color palettes defined in the colors module.  \n\u2003 – If external libraries are needed for specialized functionality, the external folder offers wrappers or compatibility layers.  \n• This layered interaction means that changes in one module (e.g., refining a statistical algorithm) automatically propagate through to improved visualization without altering the rendering logic.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n7. What are common pitfalls or error patterns encountered during use or modification?  \n• Dependency mismatches:  \n\u2003 – Since seaborn depends on libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib—and optionally scipy and statsmodels—errors can arise if versions are incompatible. Always check the required versions and consider using virtual environments.  \n• Data shape or type issues:  \n\u2003 – Many errors stem from passing data of unexpected shape (e.g., missing columns in pandas dataframes) to plotting functions. Reading the detailed error messages and comparing them with unit test examples often reveals the solution.  \n• Misalignment between data and style settings:  \n\u2003 – Changing default styles or context in _core without updating related functions in _marks can lead to inconsistent visual outputs. Test visual changes using the example gallery as a reference.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n8. What debugging approaches are recommended for resolving issues in seaborn?  \n• Replicate issues using minimal, reproducible code examples, similar to those found in the examples directory or tests.  \n• Use logging or insert breakpoint() calls in functions within modules like _core or _stats to inspect how data and state are transformed during execution.  \n• Run “make test” locally to catch failing tests early, and then use test case outputs (particularly in tests/_stats or tests/_marks) to pinpoint where expectations diverge.  \n• Verify that any changes to visual elements still produce output that matches the documented examples and tutorials.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n9. How is error handling implemented within seaborn’s core functions?  \n• While many errors are simply propagated as exceptions (such as ValueError for incorrect inputs), some modules incorporate try/except blocks to catch issues originating from lower-level libraries (like matplotlib).  \n• For instance, data transformation functions in _stats may first validate input shapes or types and then raise descriptive errors if mismatches are detected.  \n• Enhancements in error messaging over time have focused on making guidance actionable (e.g., suggesting that the user check for missing data or incorrect dataframe columns).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n10. How are core abstractions like plotting contexts implemented?  \n• The _core module provides abstractions that manage the plotting context—including figure size, resolution, and styling adjustments.  \n• These abstractions often serve as wrappers around matplotlib’s figure and axis objects, ensuring that seaborn can extend them with statistical overlays and style options.  \n• For example, the code may use context managers that temporarily set aesthetic parameters, thereby isolating individual plots from global state changes.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n11. What data structures and algorithms feature prominently in seaborn?  \n• Data Handling: Relies heavily on pandas DataFrames and numpy arrays for data manipulation, a design choice that ensures compatibility with standard Python data analysis workflows.  \n• Statistical Algorithms: Within _stats, common algorithms—such as regression, kernel density estimation, or bootstrapping—are implemented or wrapped. The underlying data structures (often arrays or dictionaries) are used to store intermediate results.  \n• Mapping and Styling: The colors module uses mappings (such as dictionaries) to map data values to color palettes, ensuring consistency across plots.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n12. How should I extend or modify statistical functionality in the _stats module?  \n• When adding new statistical estimators or procedures, follow the coding pattern used elsewhere in _stats:  \n\u2003 – Validate input data early, ensuring that arrays or Series meet the expected shape and type.  \n\u2003 – Return results in a format that can be easily consumed by upper layers (_core or _marks), such as a consistent dict or a sanitized array.  \n\u2003 – Write comprehensive unit tests in tests/_stats that provide typical cases as well as edge conditions to guarantee robust performance.  \n• Review existing functions to ensure consistent behavior and error messaging.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n13. How do I run the full test suite and what should I consider when adding new tests?  \n• To run all tests, first install the developer dependencies (e.g., with “pip install .[dev]”). Then run “make test” from the root directory.  \n• When writing new tests:  \n\u2003 – Place them in the appropriate directory (tests/_core, tests/_marks, or tests/_stats) based on which module you are testing.  \n\u2003 – Use pytest idioms and, when possible, mirror existing test structures for consistency.  \n\u2003 – Include tests for both normal and edge-case scenarios, and update code coverage metrics accordingly.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n14. Are there any common test fixtures or utilities available?  \n• The tests folder is organized to be self-contained and likely includes helper functions or fixtures (often defined in common __init__.py files or dedicated test modules) that abstract repetitive tasks such as data generation or plot setup.  \n• Leveraging these fixtures can reduce boilerplate code in new tests—review existing tests for patterns that can be reused.  \n• Additionally, examining the tests for _stats or _core might reveal examples of how to simulate input conditions that lead to expected error handling or output.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n15. How do I update or build the documentation locally when making code changes?  \n• Documentation source files reside in the doc directory. For guidance on building locally, see doc/README.md.  \n• Docstrings embedded in the code (placed in doc/_docstrings) are used to auto-generate the API reference. Ensure that any public-facing changes in API are accurately reflected here.  \n• After rebuilding, compare the output to the online documentation to verify that updates appear as expected.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n16. What are the recommendations for integrating external dependencies (e.g., scipy, statsmodels) for advanced statistical features?  \n• Seaborn supports optional statistics-based functionality that requires additional dependencies. Install these via extra requirements (“pip install seaborn[stats]”) if you plan to use or test advanced features.  \n• When modifying code that relies on these libraries, include conditional checks that provide informative error messages when the dependency is missing.  \n• Be sure to add tests (or modify existing ones) to cover scenarios both with and without these optional packages installed.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n17. How does the continuous integration (CI) process help maintain code quality?  \n• The ci directory contains scripts and configuration files for automated processes on GitHub. These scripts:  \n\u2003 – Run the full test suite on every commit/pull request, ensuring that code changes do not break existing features.  \n\u2003 – Execute flake8 and other linters to enforce code style and naming conventions.  \n\u2003 – Generate code coverage reports that help identify untested parts of the codebase.  \n• Developers should always run “make lint” locally (or rely on pre-commit hooks) in addition to tests so that code quality remains high and aligned with the repository standards.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nBy following these FAQs and using the examples and guidelines provided, developers should be better equipped to troubleshoot issues, implement new features, and maintain the high quality expected in the seaborn statistical visualization codebase.', refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=[], audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1744952710, model='o3-mini-2025-01-31', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_2d4670fb9a', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=4771, prompt_tokens=1371, total_tokens=6142, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=2304, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=1024)))
