It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nOnline documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).\n\nThe docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.\n\nTo build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nSeaborn supports Python 3.8+.\n\nInstallation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:\n\n    pip install seaborn\n\nIt is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies:\n\n    pip install seaborn[stats]\n\nSeaborn can also be installed with conda:\n\n    conda install seaborn\n\nNote that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.\n\nCiting\n------\n\nA paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTesting seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).\n\nTo test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.\n\nCode style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nSeaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn\n\nPlease submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem.

This should help you or any language model orient itself when addressing technical issues, by highlighting the core purpose, the architectural style, how modules are organized, and some of the key patterns and strategies used in the codebase.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Core Purpose and Functionality\n\n• Purpose:  \n\u2003– Seaborn is designed to simplify the creation of attractive, statistically informed visualizations in Python.  \n\u2003– It builds a high-level API on top of matplotlib to let users quickly generate complex plots without manually handling many low-level details.\n\n• Primary Features:  \n\u2003– Provides functions for both figure-level (e.g., grids, multi-plot layouts such as FacetGrid and JointGrid) and axes-level plots (e.g., scatter, bar plots, and histograms).  \n\u2003– Incorporates built-in routines for statistical estimation (e.g., regression lines, kernel density estimation) that automatically compute error bars or confidence intervals using routines housed in its _stats module.  \n\u2003– Offers rich support for custom color palettes and themes (found in the colors module) to improve visual aesthetics.  \n\u2003– Supplies extensive documentation (in the doc folder) along with tutorials and examples (in the examples directory) to help users learn both usage and best practices.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Main Architectural Patterns\n\n• Layered/Hierarchical Design:  \n\u2003– The code is organized in layers where low-level drawing routines in the _core package provide common functionality that higher-level plotting functions in _marks and statistical routines in _stats can build upon.  \n\u2003– For instance, the low-level routines handle the interface with matplotlib, while the _marks layer wraps these functionalities to create distinct visual marks (points, lines, bars, etc.).\n\n• Separation of Concerns & Modularity:  \n\u2003– There is a clear separation between visualization (layout and style), statistical transformation, and color management (colors module).  \n\u2003– Directory boundaries (seaborn/_core, seaborn/_marks, seaborn/_stats) reflect how different aspects of plotting and data processing are decoupled, allowing for easier maintenance and isolated debugging.\n\n• Integration and Extension:  \n\u2003– The external directory hints at a “plugin-like” pattern where third-party or external algorithms are integrated without polluting the core namespace. This design supports extending or wrapping external libraries (e.g., from scipy or statsmodels) for advanced statistical functionality.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3. Module Organization\n\n• seaborn/_core:  \n\u2003– Contains foundational routines for setting up plots, handling the matplotlib integration, and defining shared data structures.  \n\u2003– Likely includes functions for axis management, layout adjustments, and interfacing directly with matplotlib objects.\n\n• seaborn/_marks:  \n\u2003– Implements the abstractions for distinct graphical “marks” – the building blocks for different plot types (scatter, line, bar, etc.).  \n\u2003– Functions in this space receive processed data from _core and then determine how individual visual “elements” are rendered.\n\n• seaborn/_stats:  \n\u2003– Houses functions that perform statistical computations, such as estimation of confidence intervals, kernel density estimation, or linear regressions.  \n\u2003– These routines clear the heavy lifting for automatically adding statistical context (error bars, smoothing, etc.) to visualizations.\n\n• seaborn/colors:  \n\u2003– Manages the creation and manipulation of color palettes and themes.  \n\u2003– Contains functions and possibly utility classes to generate color maps, cycle colors, or standardize the aesthetic appearance across plots.\n\n• seaborn/external:  \n\u2003– Acts as an integration layer for external utilities, ensuring that dependencies such as statsmodels or scipy can be incorporated when advanced statistical features are requested.\n\n• tests folder (mirroring the code structure):  \n\u2003– Provides unit tests for each major component (e.g., tests/_core, tests/_marks, tests/_stats) so that each layer can be validated in isolation.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n4. Key Abstractions and Concepts\n\n• Figure- vs. Axes-level Interfaces:  \n\u2003– Seaborn distinguishes between high-level “figure” functions that automatically manage multiple subplots (e.g., FacetGrid, JointGrid) and lower-level axes functions that work over single matplotlib Axes.\n\u2003– This abstraction simplifies the user interface while allowing internal code to share common plotting logic.\n\n• Statistical Transformation Abstractions:  \n\u2003– The functions in _stats encapsulate typical statistical operations (such as smoothing and error estimation).  \n\u2003– For example, routines to automatically compute confidence intervals abstract away the details so that plotting functions just need to supply raw data.\n\n• Visual Mark Abstractions:  \n\u2003– In the _marks package, seaborn likely uses classes or function groups to represent different plot “marks” (such as bars, points, or lines).  \n\u2003– These abstractions allow a unified treatment of style parameters (color, size, shape) across different plot types.\n\n• Color Palettes and Style Contexts:  \n\u2003– The colors module and additional style context managers allow for a uniform aesthetic experience.  \n\u2003– These abstractions let users apply a theme consistently or even switch styles temporarily using context managers.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n5. Design Patterns\n\n• Factory Methods:  \n\u2003– Many of the top-level plotting functions act as factories that encapsulate a series of lower-level calls. For example, a call to plot a regression might internally choose between different implementations based on the data shape or user parameters, abstracting the complexity from the user.\n\n• Decorators:  \n\u2003– It is common in such libraries to use decorator patterns for tasks like input validation, caching of computed results, or logging warnings.  \n\u2003– Though specific decorator names aren’t listed here, you would typically find decorators around public API functions to enforce parameter checks or style settings before delegating to the core implementation.\n\n• Inheritance-based Extensions:  \n\u2003– In the _marks module, you might see a base “Mark” class with multiple subclasses (e.g., for different types of plots) that override rendering or data processing behaviors.  \n\u2003– This pattern supports both reuse and extension, making it easier to add new plot types without rewriting common routines.\n\n• Context Managers:  \n\u2003– The use of context managers (with blocks) for managing style or computation contexts is a pattern that allows temporary changes to global settings (for example, temporary style changes) while ensuring a clean exit.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n6. Error Handling Approaches\n\n• Standard Python Exception Handling:  \n\u2003– The codebase relies on raising standard exceptions (ValueError, TypeError) when user inputs or data types do not match expected formats.  \n\u2003– For instance, if a user supplies an unsupported parameter to a color palette function in colors, the function will likely raise a descriptive ValueError.\n\n• Custom Exception Hierarchies (Potential):  \n\u2003– While not explicitly detailed in the structure listing, many mature libraries define custom exceptions to signal seaborn-specific problems (e.g., malformed input data for a statistical plot).  \n\u2003– If present, these exceptions would be found in utility modules within _core or as part of a separate errors.py module.\n\n• Warnings and Preemptive Checks:  \n\u2003– The code likely uses Python’s warnings module to alert users about deprecations or non-optimal usage patterns (e.g., in cases where a user might be using an outdated parameters set).\n\u2003– This approach ensures that even when errors are not fatal, users are informed about potential pitfalls in their code.\n\n• Testing and Linting as Safety Nets:  \n\u2003– Beyond runtime error handling, the continuous integration setup in ci/ and the use of flake8 (configured in setup.cfg) and pytest for testing are integral parts of the error management strategy during development.  \n\u2003– The robust suite of tests in tests/_core, tests/_marks, and tests/_stats ensures that many edge cases are caught before a release, limiting runtime surprises.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nSummary\n\nSeaborn is architected as a layered, modular library built on matplotlib that abstracts away many of the complexities inherent in statistical plotting. By dividing responsibilities clearly—_core for base integration, _marks for visual representation, _stats for statistical processing, and colors for aesthetic consistency—it makes it easier to navigate and extend. Common design patterns such as factory methods, inheritance for mark types, decorators for input checking, and context managers for temporary style changes, all serve to create a consistent and extendable API. Error handling is achieved through standard exception raising and preemptive warnings supported by a comprehensive testing and linting framework.
