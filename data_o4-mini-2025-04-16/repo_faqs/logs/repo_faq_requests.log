There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!\n\nRequests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around `30M downloads / week`— according to GitHub, Requests is currently [depended upon](https://github.com/psf/requests/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01NzA4OTExNg%3D%3D) by `1,000,000+` repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.\n\n[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/requests/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/requests)\n[![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/requests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/requests)\n[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/psf/requests.svg)](https://github.com/psf/requests/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Installing Requests and Supported Versions\n\nRequests is available on PyPI:\n\n```console\n$ python -m pip install requests\n```\n\nRequests officially supports Python 3.8+.\n\n## Supported Features & Best–Practices\n\nRequests is ready for the demands of building robust and reliable HTTP–speaking applications, for the needs of today.\n\n- Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling\n- International Domains and URLs\n- Sessions with Cookie Persistence\n- Browser-style TLS/SSL Verification\n- Basic & Digest Authentication\n- Familiar `dict`–like Cookies\n- Automatic Content Decompression and Decoding\n- Multi-part File Uploads\n- SOCKS Proxy Support\n- Connection Timeouts\n- Streaming Downloads\n- Automatic honoring of `.netrc`\n- Chunked HTTP Requests\n\n## API Reference and User Guide available on [Read the Docs](https://requests.readthedocs.io)\n\n[![Read the Docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/ss.png)](https://requests.readthedocs.io)\n\n## Cloning the repository\n\nWhen cloning the Requests repository, you may need to add the `-c\nfetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore` flag to avoid an error about a bad commit (see\n[this issue](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2690) for more background):\n\n```shell\ngit clone -c fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore https://github.com/psf/requests.git\n```\n\nYou can also apply this setting to your global Git config:\n\n```shell\ngit config --global fetch.fsck.badTimezone ignore\n```\n\n---\n\n[![Kenneth Reitz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/kr.png)](https://kennethreitz.org) [![Python Software Foundation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psf/requests/main/ext/psf.png)](https://www.python.org/psf)\n\n\nPlease generate 15-20 frequently asked questions with detailed answers about:\n\n1.

2025-05-08 21:18:21,054 - INFO - API response ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-BV6etZiazmnpo2w756KMNFRHkgFyR', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Below is a set of 20 FAQs covering code organization, patterns, debugging, implementation details, and testing in the Requests codebase. Each answer points at concrete files or classes in src/requests or tests so you can jump right in.\n\n1. Q:  How is the Requests repository laid out on disk?  \n   A:  At the top level you have:  \n   - docs/ – the Sphinx source for user, dev, and community docs.  \n   - ext/ – static assets (images, custom themes) for docs.  \n   - src/requests/ – the entire production package. All Python modules that implement HTTP behavior live here.  \n   - tests/ – pytest test suite, including:  \n     • certs/ – sample X.509 certs (expired, valid, mTLS)  \n     • testserver/ – a self-contained HTTP server used for integration tests.  \n\n2. Q:  What are the core modules and what do they do?  \n   A:  In src/requests/ you’ll find:  \n   • api.py – top-level functions (get, post, head, etc.) that return r = Session().request(...)  \n   • sessions.py – Session class, request(), prepare_request(), send(), hooks, cookie persistence  \n   • models.py – Request, PreparedRequest, Response objects and their flow  \n   • adapters.py – HTTPAdapter and Mount/Transport Adapters (urllib3 integration, connection pooling)  \n   • cookies.py – RequestsCookieJar (dict-like cookies), wraps cookielib  \n   • auth.py – AuthBase and implementations for Basic, Digest, custom callables  \n   • structures.py – CaseInsensitiveDict for headers and OrderedDict utilities  \n   • utils.py – URL parsing, header manipulation, timeout normalization  \n   • exceptions.py – RequestException hierarchy (HTTPError, ConnectionError, Timeout, TooManyRedirects)  \n   • hooks.py – request/response hook registration and dispatch  \n\n3. Q:  How does a simple call requests.get(url) actually work?  \n   A:  Rough flow:  \n   1. api.get() in api.py calls Session().get()  \n   2. Session.get() delegates to Session.request()  \n   3. Session.request() builds a Request object and calls prepare_request()  \n   4. prepare_request() returns a PreparedRequest with all headers, URL, body set  \n   5. Session.send(prep, …) picks the right HTTPAdapter via adapters.py (mounted by scheme)  \n   6. HTTPAdapter.send() uses urllib3.PoolManager/ConnectionPool to perform the network I/O  \n   7. A Response is built in adapters.py and returned through Session.send()  \n   8. API.get() returns that Response  \n\n4. Q:  What design patterns are used heavily in Requests?  \n   A:  \n   - Adapter pattern: HTTPAdapter in adapters.py abstracts away transport details (urllib3, SOCKS).  \n   - Strategy/Pluggable authentication: auth.py’s AuthBase allows you to inject custom auth strategies via Session(auth=...).  \n   - Observer/hooks: hooks.py implements “response” and “pre_request” hooks so callers can register callbacks.  \n   - Factory: Session() acts as a factory for PreparedRequest + ConnectionPool.  \n   - Decorator: Retry logic in urllib3 is layered on top of base HTTPAdapter pools.  \n\n5. Q:  Are there naming or style conventions I need to follow?  \n   A:  Yes. We follow PEP8 with 4-space indents, snake_case for functions and variables, CamelCase for classes. Any “public API” lives in __init__.py or api.py. Internal methods are prefixed with underscore. We use explicit relative imports (e.g. from .models import Response).\n\n6. Q:  If I want to add a new high-level feature (e.g. a new convenience method), where do I hook in?  \n   A:  \n   1. Add a function in api.py (e.g. def patch_json(...): ) – it should create or reuse a Session and call session.request().  \n   2. In Session.request() (sessions.py), add any param defaults or special handling.  \n   3. If you need a new PreparedRequest attribute, extend models.PreparedRequest and adapt prepare_request().  \n   4. Add tests in tests/ to exercise the new API, ideally using testserver or a pytest fixture.  \n\n7. Q:  How do I register a new transport adapter (e.g. a custom protocol)?  \n   A:  \n   1. Subclass HTTPAdapter in adapters.py, override init_poolmanager() to configure a custom urllib3 PoolManager.  \n   2. In your code, do session.mount("myscheme://", MyAdapter()). Requests will use it whenever the URL has “myscheme”.  \n   3. Ensure your adapter.set_cert(), send() signature matches HTTPAdapter’s.  \n\n8. Q:  What are the most common runtime errors and how do I track them down?  \n   A:  \n   - SSL certificate verify failures: catch SSLError in adapters.py; replicate with tests/certs.  \n   - Proxy/auth handshake issues: enable logging on requests.packages.urllib3 to see CONNECT and 407 responses.  \n   - Timeout vs read timeout: Session.request() normalizes timeout tuples in utils. Wrong type raises InvalidTimeout.  \n\n9. Q:  I’m seeing “Connection pool is full” or leaking sockets. What’s going on?  \n   A:  Look in adapters.py: HTTPAdapter has pool_connections and pool_maxsize. If you open too many concurrent connections without closing (Response.close()), pools will queue. Use with r.close() or stream=False (auto-closes). In tests, you can call session.close() or r.raw.release_conn().\n\n10. Q:  How do redirects and max_redirects work under the hood?  \n    A:  In sessions.py, Session.resolve_redirects() handles 301/302/303 codes. Too many hops raises TooManyRedirects from exceptions.py. The default is allow_redirects=True, max_redirects=30. To modify, pass allow_redirects or max_redirects to Session.request().\n\n11. Q:  How is error handling structured?  \n    A:  exceptions.py defines a hierarchy:  \n    - RequestException (base)  \n      - ConnectionError (wrapping urllib3’s NewConnectionError)  \n      - SSLError  \n      - Timeout  \n      - TooManyRedirects  \n      - HTTPError (raised via Response.raise_for_status())  \n    Adapters catch urllib3 exceptions, wrap them in RequestException subclasses, and re-raise.\n\n12. Q:  What internal data structures should I be aware of?  \n    A:  \n    - CaseInsensitiveDict (structures.py) for headers  \n    - RequestsCookieJar (cookies.py) for cookies, subclassing cookielib.CookieJar  \n    - PreparedRequest has .body (bytes/str/file-like) and .headers (CaseInsensitiveDict)  \n    - Response.raw is a urllib3.HTTPResponse wrapped in RawResponse within models.py  \n\n13. Q:  How are authentication backends implemented?  \n    A:  auth.py exposes AuthBase. Custom auth must implement __call__(self, request): mutate request.headers or body, then return request. Session.request() invokes auth hooks before send(). For Digest you see DigestAuth class; it attaches “Authorization” headers and manages challenge–response.\n\n14. Q:  What logging hooks exist for debugging?  \n    A:  - "response" hook: you can register a callback in Session.hooks["response"] to inspect Response before it returns.  \n    - urllib3 logging: set logging.getLogger("urllib3").setLevel(DEBUG) to trace connection pooling and HTTP flows.  \n    - requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings() to suppress InsecureRequestWarning.\n\n15. Q:  How do I debug SSL/TLS issues locally?  \n    A:  The tests/certs folder holds CA and server keys. tests/testserver can start a TLS server. Look at tests/test_ssl.py for examples. You can point Session.verify to tests/certs/valid/ca/server.crt or disable verify to see differences.\n\n16. Q:  How is multipart upload implemented?  \n    A:  In models.py, PreparedRequest.prepare_body() inspects files param. It uses requests.packages.urllib3.MultipartEncoder under the hood (in utils.py if installed), or falls back to manual boundary encoding. Look at test_multipart.py in tests/ for examples.\n\n17. Q:  How do timeouts work?  \n    A:  In utils.py, check_timeout() normalizes float vs (connect, read) tuples. Session.request() passes the tuple to HTTPAdapter.send(), which in turn calls PoolManager.urlopen(timeout=…). urllib3 distinguishes connect and read timeout. If you pass a single float, both phases use that timeout.\n\n18. Q:  How are tests organized and what fixtures can I reuse?  \n    A:  tests/ uses pytest. Subfolders under certs/ are consumed by SSL tests. testserver/ provides an HTTPServer instance launched via a pytest fixture in tests/conftest.py. Look at client/server fixtures there. You can import client and server fixtures in your new tests.\n\n19. Q:  What should I watch out for when writing new tests?  \n    A:  \n    - Do not hit the public Internet; use testserver or requests-mock.  \n    - Use tmp_path for file-based operations.  \n    - Clean up sessions with session.close().  \n    - Mark Windows-specific tests with @pytest.mark.skipif(os.name=="nt").  \n    - When testing cert verification, copy or symlink correct certs from tests/certs.\n\n20. Q:  How do I contribute and run the test suite locally?  \n    A:  \n    1. Clone with git clone -c fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore …  \n    2. Create a virtualenv with Python 3.8+ and pip install -e .[tests] (this installs pytest and dev dependencies).  \n    3. Run pytest at the project root. Use -q for quiet, -x to stop on first failure.  \n    4. To run a subset: pytest tests/test_auth.py::TestBasicAuth.  \n    5. To regenerate docs or check builds, see docs/dev in the docs folder.\n\nThese FAQs should point you at the exact files and patterns used by Requests. When fixing bugs or adding features, trace through api.py → sessions.py → adapters.py → urllib3, use the testserver fixtures, and lean on the rich exceptions and hooks framework already in place.
