It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nOnline documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).\n\nThe docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.\n\nTo build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nSeaborn supports Python 3.8+.\n\nInstallation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:\n\n    pip install seaborn\n\nIt is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies:\n\n    pip install seaborn[stats]\n\nSeaborn can also be installed with conda:\n\n    conda install seaborn\n\nNote that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.\n\nCiting\n------\n\nA paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTesting seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).\n\nTo test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.\n\nCode style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nSeaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn\n\nPlease submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem. Questions about usage are more at home on StackOverflow, where there is a [seaborn tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/seaborn).\n\n\nPlease generate 15-20 frequently asked questions with detailed answers about:\n\n1. Code Organization and Architecture:\n   - How is the codebase structured?\n   - What are the key modules and their responsibilities?\n   - How do the different components interact?\n\n2. Common Patterns and Conventions:\n   - What design patterns are commonly used?\n   - What are the naming conventions and code style expectations?\n   - Are there specific patterns for implementing new features?\n\n3. Typical Debugging Approaches:\n   - What are common error patterns and their solutions?\n   - How to debug specific types of issues in this codebase?\n   - What are common pitfalls when modifying this code?\n\n4. Implementation Details:\n   - How are core abstractions implemented?\n   - What are the key algorithms or data structures used?\n   - How does the error handling system work?\n\n5. Testing Considerations:\n   - How is testing typically done in this codebase?\n   - What should be considered when writing tests?\n   - Are there common test fixtures or utilities?\n\nFor each question, provide detailed, specific answers with concrete examples from the codebase when possible. Focus on information that would be most valuable to someone trying to fix bugs or implement new features. The FAQs should reflect the actual patterns and practices used in this specific repository, not generic software development advice.\n'}], 'n': 1, 'max_completion_tokens': 15000, 'response_format': {'type': 'text'}, 'reasoning_effort': 'high', 'store': True}
2025-05-08 21:18:10,099 - INFO - API response ChatCompletion(id='chatcmpl-BV6etvcHUC4JD7MH0RP6L8X2RIPlg', choices=[Choice(finish_reason='stop', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content='Below is a set of 17 frequently‐asked questions (and answers) organized by topic. They are drawn from the actual Seaborn code layout and conventions, and should help you get up and running when fixing bugs or adding features.\n\n1. CODE ORGANIZATION AND ARCHITECTURE\n\nQ1. How is the Seaborn codebase laid out on disk?  \nA1. At the top level you have:  \n  • ci/        – Continuous‐integration configs  \n  • doc/       – Sphinx source, tutorials, “what’s new,” extensions  \n  • examples/  – Standalone example scripts for the gallery  \n  • licences/  – License texts  \n  • seaborn/   – The library itself, subdivided into:  \n      – _core/    (plot‐factory classes, high‐level functions)  \n      – _marks/   (primitive drawing functions: scatter, line, bar, etc.)  \n      – _stats/   (statistical estimators: kernel density, regression fit, etc.)  \n      – colors/   (palette generators, colormaps, utility functions)  \n      – external/ (wrappers for optional dependencies, e.g. statsmodels)  \n  • tests/     – Parallel layout to seaborn/, with pytest suites in _core/, _marks/, _stats/.\n\nQ2. What are the key modules and their responsibilities?  \nA2.  \n  • seaborn._core: Implements the Figure‐level and Axes‐level plotting facades. Classes like RelationalPlot, CategoricalPlot, RegressionPlot live here. Top‐level functions (scatterplot, boxplot, lmplot, etc.) import from this package.  \n  • seaborn._marks: Very low‐level “marks”—single‐element drawing primitives that wrap matplotlib (e.g. _marks.scatter, _marks.line, _marks.bar).  \n  • seaborn._stats: Functions for computing statistics: _stats.regression._linear_fit, _stats.kde._kde, bootstrapping, ECDF, etc.  \n  • seaborn.colors: High‐level palette generators (dark_palette, diverging_palette), colormaps, hex/RGB conversion utilities.  \n  • seaborn.external: Lightweight compatibility shims for optional dependencies (e.g. a fallback SciPy stats implementation if SciPy isn’t installed).\n\nQ3. How do the components interact at runtime?  \nA3. A top‐level API call (say seaborn.scatterplot) dispatches into a factory in _core (RelationalPlot). That class:  \n  1. Validates and reshapes the pandas DataFrame or 1D vectors you passed.  \n  2. Calls a statistical aggregator in _stats if needed (e.g. for binned plots).  \n  3. Iterates over “hues” or “facets,” calling the primitive drawing functions in _marks.  \n  4. Applies color or style information from seaborn.colors.  \n  5. Returns either a matplotlib Axes (axes‐level) or a FacetGrid (figure‐level).\n\n2. COMMON PATTERNS AND CONVENTIONS\n\nQ4. What design patterns recur in Seaborn’s code?  \nA4.  \n  • Factory/Template Method (in _core): A base Plot class defines a workflow—data‐prep, stat‐agg, map‐plot, finalize—and subclasses override hooks.  \n  • Strategy (in _stats): Different statistical routines (KDE vs histogram vs regression) all conform to a common fit interface.  \n  • Decorator (for registries): Many plot functions are registered via decorators so they appear in the API docs and in the autodoc registry for sphinx.\n\nQ5. What naming conventions and code‐style rules should I follow?  \nA5.  \n  • PEP8 with some strict exceptions:  \n     – snake_case for functions and variables  \n     – CamelCase for classes  \n     – Private modules/functions begin with an underscore (e.g. _core, _compute_aggregate).  \n  • All public API functions must be documented in doc/_docstrings with a complete signature and parameter list.  \n  • Use black‐style formatting for Python, and run flake8 (make lint or pre-commit) to catch stray style issues.  \n\nQ6. If I want to implement a new plot type, what pattern should I follow?  \nA6.  \n  1. In seaborn/_core create a new Plot subclass (e.g. class MyPlot(CategoricalPlot)).  \n  2. Override or extend these methods:  \n     – _validate_input(self, data, kwargs)  \n     – _aggregate(self, data)  (if you need a custom statistic)  \n     – _draw_plot(self, ax, data, color, **kwargs) (use primitives from _marks)  \n     – _finalize(self, ax) (axis labels, legend)  \n  3. Register a new top‐level function in seaborn/__init__.py or a submodule, pointing to MyPlot.  \n  4. Write docs under doc/_tutorial or doc/_docstrings and add an example under examples/.\n\n3. TYPICAL DEBUGGING APPROACHES\n\nQ7. What are the most common errors I’ll see in Seaborn, and how do I fix them?  \nA7.  \n  • “Data must be numeric”: Usually you passed a column of dtype object. Cast it or drop NAs.  \n  • “Legend without handles”: You’ve overridden color or label mapping; check that you pass hue and palette correctly—often palette missing a level will bite you.  \n  • Inconsistent lengths: If you pass a numpy array and a pandas series of different length. Always align or convert to a single DataFrame via pd.DataFrame(dict(...)).  \n  • Deprecation warnings from matplotlib: check your default rcParams and update calls to methods that have moved.\n\nQ8. How should I go about debugging a plotting bug (e.g. no output, misaligned points)?  \nA8.  \n  1. Set breakpoints or print statements in seaborn/_core. For example, in RelationalPlot.map_dataframe, verify that DataFrame slices have the expected columns.  \n  2. Step into the call to the primitive (e.g. _marks.scatter); confirm that the x, y arrays you pass into ax.scatter are correct.  \n  3. Inspect the Axes object after the call (ax.lines, ax.collections) to see if anything was drawn.  \n  4. If nothing shows, turn on verbose/logging in matplotlib (mpl.rcParams["verbose.level"] = "debug") to catch silent failures.\n\nQ9. What pitfalls should I watch out for when modifying core routines?  \nA9.  \n  • Side‐effects on shared state: _core classes store state (self.variables, self.colors); be careful when subclassing not to reuse mutable defaults.  \n  • Breaking backward compatibility: changes in signature of a public API (scatterplot, histplot) must be mirrored in docstrings, tutorials, and the API reference in doc/_templates/autosummary.  \n  • Interaction between figure‐level and axes‐level: figure‐level functions (relplot) wrap axes‐level ones. A change in the latter may require adapting relplot’s wrapper logic in _core/facetgrid.py.\n\n4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\n\nQ10. How are Figure‐level vs. Axes‐level plots distinguished in the code?  \nA10.  \n  • Axes‐level plots are simple functions (scatterplot, lineplot, boxplot) defined in seaborn/_core/relational.py or categorical.py. They take an existing ax= kwarg and return that Axes.  \n  • Figure‐level plots (relplot, catplot, jointplot) are implemented via classes in _core/facetgrid.py. They build a FacetGrid or JointGrid and then call the corresponding axes‐level functions inside each subplot.\n\nQ11. What data‐shaping utilities does Seaborn provide?  \nA11.  \n  • _core.utils:melt, wide_to_long helpers for reshaping wide vs. long data.  \n  • index_to_pos for dealing with categorical levels on the x/y axes.  \n  • GroupBy‐based summaries (self._grouped_statistic in Plot classes) that wrap pandas groupby + apply.\n\nQ12. Which algorithms are used for smoothing/regression/density estimation?  \nA12.  \n  • Kernel-density estimation in _stats.kde uses scipy.stats.gaussian_kde when SciPy is available, otherwise falls back to a minimal pure‐python implementation in external.  \n  • Linear regression in _stats.regression calls statsmodels.api.OLS if statsmodels is installed; a fallback to numpy.polyfit lives in external.  \n  • Loess smoothing is implemented in _stats.loess with low‐level matrix computations; you can see the bandwith selection algorithm in that module.\n\nQ13. How does error handling and user feedback work?  \nA13.  \n  • Input validation: each Plot subclass has a _validate_parameters hook that raises ValueError with detailed messages.  \n  • Fallback warnings: use warnings.warn to tell users when optional dependencies are missing or defaults changed.  \n  • Deprecation warnings: use seaborn.utils.deprecate to issue a FutureWarning and map old parameter names to new ones.\n\n5. TESTING CONSIDERATIONS\n\nQ14. How are tests organized, and what do they cover?  \nA14.  \n  • tests/_core: tests of plot factories, checking that data is passed correctly, that output Axes have expected artists.  \n  • tests/_marks: tests of individual primitives, often by comparing the return value from a function in matplotlib (e.g. Line2D instance, PathCollection).  \n  • tests/_stats: tests of statistical functions, comparing output arrays to known values (often via numpy.testing.assert_allclose).  \n  • No full‐image regression: tests assume you inspect objects rather than pixel‐matching.\n\nQ15. What should I consider when writing a new test?  \nA15.  \n  • Use pytest fixtures like example_data or facetgrid_factory (defined in tests/conftest.py).  \n  • Keep tests small and focused: if you add a new Plot subclass, write one test that calls it on a small DataFrame and inspects ax.collections or ax.lines.  \n  • Parametrize edge cases: empty data, single‐level hue, missing values.  \n  • Use tmp_path for testing file writes (e.g. in _stats functions that dump output).\n\nQ16. Are there common test utilities I can reuse?  \nA16.  \n  • fixtures in tests/conftest.py: e.g. tips, iris DataFrame.  \n  • Helper functions in tests/_core/test_utils.py: assert_axes_equal, assert_collections.  \n  • numpy.testing for numerical comparisons, and matplotlib.testing.decorators for tests that require interactive backends.\n\nQ17. How do I run the full test suite and check coverage locally?  \nA17.  \n  1. Install dev dependencies:  \n       pip install .[dev]  \n  2. Run pytest with coverage:  \n       pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q  \n       coverage run -m pytest  \n       coverage report -m  \n  3. If a new module is untested, you’ll see missing lines in the coverage report. Add tests until coverage is satisfactory (the CI requires > 95%).\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  \nWith these questions and answers, you should have a solid starting point for understanding the overall architecture, following established patterns, debugging effectively, digging into core implementations, and writing robust tests when working in the Seaborn codebase.
